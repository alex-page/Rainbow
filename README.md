## Usage

The URL takes a foreground color that will be changed to make a 4.5 contrast on the background color:

[https://a11ycolor.now.sh/red/red](https://a11ycolor.now.sh/red/red)
```json
{
  "a11ycolor": "#000000"
}
```

[https://a11ycolor.now.sh/000/000](https://a11ycolor.now.sh/000/000)
```json
{
  "a11ycolor": "#757575"
}
```


## Getting started
